# Wavelet based Pulse Shaping for NOMA

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique, proposed in literature for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. 
The NOMA system model consists of the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as a pulse shaping technique in conjunction with 
a variable power domain for various users, allocated in proportion to each user's channel gain. OFDM technique based on wavelet filter banks, namely 
wavelet OFDM (WOFDM) has been utilized in digital communication to improve the system robustness to noise and adjacent channel interference, and is 
therefore anticipated to be adopted for the NOMA technique. WOFDM in NOMA (WNOMA) outperforms OFDM-based conventional NOMA (CNOMA) with reference to 
interference mitigation, bandwidth efficiency, spectral confinement, and multi-user capacity.
